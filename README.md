# FramePicker
Plucks keyframes from images sequences at standard intervals and drops them into a directory

Frames.php goes through a source directory at interval distances you set.
Comparison.php generates an html file to make it easier to eyeball your images in a batch after redraw in Stable Diffusion.

Reasoning here is that keyframing in Ebsynth is tricky and manual, and these little command line php scripts make it just a little easier. Instructions are inline, inside the code. Hope this message finds you well.
